# MapMaker

Map Maker is a tool for compiling text based map data into JSON objects
that can be used by the GoDungeon engine. It isn't (currently) a very
optimised output format (tile information is repeated too often) but it is
importable for the time being.

Not all features planned for GoDungeon are currenty implemented in
MapMaker. The plan is to implement chanes in the map compiler as features
approach a usable state in GoDungeon.

A more in depth set of instructions will be provided in the future. For
now there are a few examples of how to format maps in the fixtures
directory.
